Developed a sophisticated predictive analytics system for charity fundraising campaign "SJ22", analysing donation patterns of 79,469 donors to optimise solicitation strategies. The project utilised advanced statistical modelling to predict donation likelihood and amounts, enabling data-driven decisions for maximising campaign profitability through targeted solicitation.

## Overview
The project addresses the critical challenge of optimising fundraising campaign efficiency by predicting both donation probability and expected amounts. Through comprehensive analysis of donor behaviour and advanced statistical modelling, the system provides recommendations for donor solicitation based on expected revenue against fixed solicitation costs (â‚¬2.00). The research focused on developing a robust prediction framework that combines probability and amount predictions to maximise campaign financial performance.
